  "Find replacement fonts for characters in STRING if they were drawn on STREAM.
Use TEXT-STYLE if non-NIL, or the current text style of the stream if
NIL. This function returns a list of individual parts of the original
string together with the appropriate text style to use. The returned
valus is of the form:

    (STRING FAMILY FACE)

If FAMILY and FACE are NIL, this indicates that the base text style
contains all the characters of the given string.

Example: Assume that the text GREEK is written in greek, and the
default font does not contain any greek characters, and this function
is called as follows:

  (find-replacement-text-styles \"abcGREEKdef\")

The return value would then be:
  ((\"abc\" nil nil)
   (\"GREEK\" \"Greek Font Family\" \"Greek Font Style\")
   (\"def\" nil nil))

The second and third values of each element are appropriate for
arguments to CLIM:MAKE-TEXT-STYLE."
