\section{Introduction}

As of 2017 Common Lisp ecosystem doesn't have free native graphic user
interface toolkit but McCLIM (and recently opensourced CLIM2). Other
solutions are based on foreign tools (LTK, CommonQt or EQL5). Another
frequently used approach is creating web applications witha
frameworks. Commercial solutions are CLIM2, Common Graphics and CAPI.

CLIM specification is large and requires some initial work from the
programmer to get the grasp of CLIM programming. Needless to say,
implementation of such specification is a non-trivial undertaking and
indeed, McCLIM development consumed many man-hours of a bright
developers through the first decade of XX century. In the second
decade development pace slowed down a little to get in track again
during the last year 2016, thanks to individuals like Robert Strandh
(current project leader), Alessandro Serra and others.
