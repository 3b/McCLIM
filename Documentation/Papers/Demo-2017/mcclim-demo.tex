\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  McCLIM is a free open source implementation of CLIM II specification
  with extensions proposed by Franz Inc. in \emph{CLIM 2 User Guide,
    version 2.2.2}. In this talk we will summarize the recent
  development status and some key concepts of \emph{Common Lisp
    Interface Manager} with small demonstration of the application
  using it.
