\section{Recent development achievements}

During the last year we have replaced various functionalities with the
third party systems. \emph{Bordeaux Threads} library is responsible
for threading, \emph{OptiCL} for handling raster images etc. We have
also refreshed the McCLIM website to provide up-to-date
information. Some work has been done to assure its portability across
implementations. As of 2017-01-25 it is known to work on \emph{CCL},
\emph{CLISP}, \emph{CMUCL}, \emph{ECL} and \emph{SBCL}.

After that we have started a crowd funding campaign which allowed us
to finance bounties and some constant development work (40 hours per
month). It was a huge success which assured us, that people are lively
interested in seeing \emph{McCLIM} working. We have gathered some very
valuable feedback which helped us to plan a road map for the
development.

A lot of effort is put in \emph{McCLIM} internals to assure quality
and ease of use, and to provide a learning material for new users. One
of the most discouraging parts of using CLIM is the software
complexity with a little of material which helps to understand how to
use it.
