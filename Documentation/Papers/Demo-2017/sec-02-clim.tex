\section{Common Lisp Interface Manager}

CLIM 2.0 specification was released in 1993. It is meant to be
portable across Common Lisp implementations, operating systems and
mapping to the target window system (like X, GTK or graphical-forms).

The key feature of the standard is providing convenient
object-oriented abstraction over the interface presented to the user
(without compromising programmer's \emph{ability} to change low-level
details). With these things in mind it is a specification which
implements model-view-presenter architectural pattern in a consistent
way with good defaults and ability to customize the behavior.

Key CLIM components are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Application Frames
\item Panes
\item Drawing primitives
\item Formatted output
\item Presentation types
\item Commands
\item Output records
\item Menus and dialogs
\end{itemize}
