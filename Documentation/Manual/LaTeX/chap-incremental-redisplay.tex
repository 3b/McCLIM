\chapter{Incremental redisplay}

CLIM applications are most often structured around the \emph{command
  loop}.  The various steps that such an application follow are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{command} is acquired because the user, either typed the
  name of the command to an interactive prompt, selected a menu item
  representing a command, or clicked on an active object that
  translates to a command.
\item The \emph{arguments} to that command are acquired.  As with the
  acquisition of the command itself, various gestures can be used to
  supply the arguments.
\item The command is \emph{executed} with the acquired arguments.
  Typically, the command modifies some part of the \emph{model}%
\footnote{Some authors use the term \emph{business logic} instead of
  \emph{model}.  Both words refer to the representation of the
  intrinsic purpose of the application, as opposed to superficial
  characteristics such as how objects are physically presented to the
  user.} contained in one or more slots in the application frame.
\item The \emph{redisplay functions} associated with the visible panes
  of the application are executed.  Typically, the redisplay function
  erases all the output and traverses the entire model in order to
  produce a new version of that output.  Since output exists in the
  form of \emph{output records}, this process involves deleting the
  existing output records and computing an entirely new set of them.
\end{itemize}
